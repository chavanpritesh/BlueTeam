Active Directory

Active Directory Domain Services, also called AD DS, is a service used in Windows Server to manage computers, users, 
and other devices in a network. You can think of it like a large phone book for a company. Just like a phone book stores 
names and numbers in an organized way, AD DS stores information about computers, users, printers, and other resources. 
This helps administrators control the network in one place instead of managing everything separately.



 Why Active Directory is Useful

Active Directory gives a structured and central place to manage everything. 


benefits are:

1. It organizes users and devices in a clear, hierarchical structure.
2. It allows changes to be made from multiple locations and keeps everything updated across the network.
3. It provides one place to access network resources such as files, printers, and shared folders.
4. It supports trust relationships between networks, even from older or different systems.
5. It increases security by applying the same policies and permissions to everyone.
6. It can scale easily when a company grows, meaning it supports large networks with many users.
7. It allows sharing of resources and controlling who can use them.
8. It gives reporting and auditing features that help track changes and identify security issues.



 What is a Directory Service

A directory service stores information about all users, computers, and services. It also provides tools to search, manage, 
and apply security rules. It helps organizations control user accounts and resources in one place.



 Important Services in AD DS

1. Domain Services for login, searching, and communication between users and domains.
2. Certificate Services to create and manage digital certificates for secure communication.
3. Lightweight Directory Services for applications that use the LDAP protocol.
4. Directory Federation Services for single sign on, so one login works for multiple applications.
5. Rights Management Services to protect email and documents by controlling who can read or edit them.



 Domain Controllers

A Domain Controller is a server that runs AD DS. It stores the directory database and verifies user login requests. It also 
ensures that data is copied across all domain controllers in the network so that information stays consistent.



 Objects in Active Directory

 Container Objects can hold other objects. Examples are Forest, Tree, Domain, Organizational Unit.
 Leaf Objects cannot hold other objects. Examples are users, computers, printers.



 Some Common Active Directory Terms

 Schema defines what type of objects and attributes can exist.
 Global Catalog holds information about every object, which helps in searching quickly.
 Forest Root Domain is the first domain created in a forest.
 Sites represent the physical layout of the network.
 LDAP is a standard protocol used by AD for communication.
 Organizational Unit (OU) is used to group users or computers for easier management.
 Group Policy is used to apply the same settings or security rules to many users or computers.
 Trust Relationship allows users from one domain to access resources in another domain.
 Replication keeps all domain controllers updated with the same directory data.
 Kerberos is the authentication method used to verify users securely.
 Group is a collection of users or computers to simplify permission management.



 Advantages of Active Directory

1. Centralized management of users and computers.
2. Scales easily for large organizations.
3. Allows group policy management for consistent settings.
4. Provides secure authentication and authorization.
5. Supports single sign on for easy access across applications.



 Disadvantages of Active Directory

1. Setup and management can be complex and may need expert knowledge.
2. Licensing and hardware cost can be high.
3. Can be vulnerable to attacks if not secured properly.
4. Works best mainly with Windows systems.
5. Needs regular maintenance and updates.
